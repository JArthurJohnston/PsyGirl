# PsyGirl
A third person stealth/action RPG Im making in Unity

# Ideas for features
-   a slow time ability
-   the player will have 2 attacks, one for each trigger. the bumper buttons will slow time, and let the player select another ability. The user will have no other control over the player while this selection menu is open (a soft pause). Maybe the player will still be able to move the camera
